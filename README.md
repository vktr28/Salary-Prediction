Hello there!
Since a long while I've been learning Data Science and ML
This is my very first project that predicts an average income of a person who provides their experience and education level
Unfortunately, this project doesn't carry any useful information owing to being generated by AI and it's small size
However, all the fake data can be inplaced by the real one and afterwards it may become a little bit valuable indeed
